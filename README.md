<h1>LetsLearnCSharp!</h1>

C# ("See-sharp") is a general-purpose, high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms.
C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

<h2>Why am I learning C#?</h2>
To put it simply: I want to make video games. The Unity engine in part depends on C# (and C++, we'll tackle that later).
So, in order to make rad games (and become a better programmer as I do it), I should learn C#.
This is step one of many on this journey :)

Quick note: You don't NEED to learn C# to use Unity!
But, if you want to become a better Unity developer, having a solid understanding of C# will be a huge bonus.

<h2>How am I learning C#?</h2>
Originally I was going to try and find a decent, well-reviewed textbook. That's how I learned JavaScript before beginning my apprenticeship at Launch Academy
(see: <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke, bookmark it).</a>
I'm a big fan of Marijn's work and how effective the process of: Read, Experiment, Proceed is for a learner of my style.

Enter: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org's latest offering</a>

This is what this repository will be hosting: My process through completeing the (New) Foundational C# with Microsoft certification.

I wanted to ensure my progress was being stored somewhere other than my local machine. This 2017 macbook air can only get me so far beyond this point (Fall 2023).

If you're new to C#, like I am, or are interested in discussing all things video games (and what makes them such impressive feats of engineering), message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-mccredy/" target="_blank">Linkedin!</a>

Thanks for reading :)
